                <p>
                    My name is Steven Scoville, and I’m currently studying Information Technology with the goal of
                    becoming a software developer. Before shifting into IT, I served four years in the U.S. Army as
                    a paratrooper and Military Police and worked several security and dispatch positions. Those
                    experiences gave me discipline, problem-solving skills, and a strong work ethic that I now bring
                    into coding.
                </p>

                <p>
                    I’ve grown passionate about development through building hands-on projects in C#, HTML, and CSS.
                    I enjoy figuring out how things work, fixing problems, and creating clean, functional designs.
                    This site highlights my progress as I continue learning and developing my abilities.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Outside of coding, I spend a lot of time gaming, exploring new music, and occasionally picking up
                    the guitar to learn something new. I also enjoy spending time with my family, which keeps me
                    grounded and motivated as I work toward a future career in software development.
