        <h1 id="aboutMe">About Me</h1>
        
        <p>
        My name is Steven Scoville, and I am currently studying Information Technology with the goal of becoming a software developer. Before transitioning into IT, I served four years in the U.S. Army as a paratrooper and Military Police, followed by several roles in security and dispatch. These experiences helped develop my discipline, problem-solving skills, and strong work ethic, which I now apply to programming.
        </p>

        <p>
        I have grown passionate about software development through hands-on projects using C#, HTML, and CSS. I enjoy learning how systems work, troubleshooting issues, and creating clean, functional designs. This site highlights my academic progress as I continue building my technical skills.
        </p>

        <p>
        Outside of coding, I enjoy gaming, discovering new music, and occasionally learning guitar. I also value spending time with my family, which keeps me grounded and motivated as I work toward a career in software development.
        </p>
